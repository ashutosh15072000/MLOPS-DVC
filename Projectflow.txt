## BUILDING PIPELINE:
1. Create a Github repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2. Add Src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3  Add data,models,reports directories to .gitignore file.
4. Now git add,commit,push


echo "# MLOPS-DVC" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ashutosh15072000/MLOPS-DVC.git
git push -u origin main


Seting up dvc pipeline (without params)
5.Create a new file folder called dvc.yaml and stages to it.
6.Dvc init then do "dvc repro" test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7.Now git add, commit,push


Setting up the dvc pipeline (with params)

8. Add params.yaml file
9. Add params setup 
10. Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline along with params
11. Now git add, commit,push

EXPERIEMENT WITH DVC

12. pip install dvclive
13. Add the dvclive code block (mentioned below)
14. Do "dvc exp run", it will create a new dvc.yaml(if already not there) and dvclive directory (each run will be considered as an experiment by DVC)
15. Do "dvc exp show" on terminal to see the experiments or use extension on VSCode (install dvc extension)
16. Do "dvc exp remove {exp-name}" to remove exp (optional) | "dvc exp apply {exp-name}" to reproduce prev exp
17. Change params, re-run code (produce new experiments)
18. Now git add, commit, push
